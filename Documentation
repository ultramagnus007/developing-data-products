K-Mean Clustering Demonstration
This project has two part
   
 (I) Artificial Data Generation for this user has to specify 2 parameters
      1. Number of clusters = K1
    	for this K1 two Dimensional points are generated from normal distribution having standard deviation 4,for both x and y values
        Xmean = matrix(rnorm(2*K1, sd = 4), K1, 2)
        Now we have K1 cluster points for data generation
      2. Number of data points = n
 	we generate n two dimensional values from normal distribution having standard deviation 1
 	deviation = matrix(rnorm(n * 2), n, 2)
 	
 	The values corresponds to deviation arround the K1 cluster calculated above 	
 	and we randomly assign them to above generated K1 cluster points like
 	
 	id<-clussample(1:K1, n, replace = TRUE)
 
   Now the sample data is generated around K1 cluster using above n points
   	data = deviation + Xmean[id, ]
 
  These Cluster-Ids centers are showing on 2-D graph in form of number.
  Different Color-points belong to different cluster
  
 
 (II) Applying K-Mean Clustering Algorithm
    taking Input from user using sliderInput K2, how many cluster he want to apply of K means clustering
    
    After applying K mean Clustering algorithm
   	km.out = kmeans(data, K2, nstart = 15)
    now cluster are shown as numbers and Data points belong to these cluster shown in different Color
